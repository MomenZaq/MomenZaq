# Hi, I'm Momen 💻

Android Developer | Software Engineering

A simple geek of Android development and I have been preparing myself to be a highly skilled developer in Android and I learn new stuff every day to be on top of Android technologies, best practices, and convey the latest techniques in Android.

I enjoy building great software and helping others do the same.

I started my career in Computer Engineering in 2013 and I like what I do, Now my favorite activity is learning and developing.
My day can not pass without learning or coding!
I love challenges and the best challenge for me is to challenge my self to be better and help people.
